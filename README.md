# <h1 align='center'> White-Black-Hacking-

### This is a repository where I upload all of the tools and experiences I have used for hacking. 

### `NOTE:`
#### 0. You should probably dual boot another linux system or prepare your usb for live boot persistence. 
#### 1. I will not upload the result files as they may include others' private information. 
#### 2. I may, instead, upload photos of the results with others' information blurred out.
#### 3. Act ethical. It may be fun to hack into, for example, someone's network connection, but don't ruin it at the least
#### 4. If you can't act ethically, at least don't get caught. 
#### 5. Consider yourself warned.
